# WirelessComm_Demos
### Some Demos are available for Wireless Communication simulation. Currently those are available for quick lookup:

#### Fundamentals of Wireless Communication (David Tse)
- Capacity of MIMO Fast Fading Channel (Section 8.1~8.2)
- Beam Signature Pattern in Polar Domain (Ch 7)
- Proportional Fair Scheduler (Section 6.7)
- Rotation Code (Section 3.2)
- More will be added.

#### Reproduce Papers
- Spatially Sparse Precoding in mmWave Channels
- OMP and its variant (SWOMP)
- More will be added.
